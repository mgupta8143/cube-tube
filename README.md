## What is Cube Tube?
Cube Tube is an Android-exclusive game built using Unity and C# where a cube has to dodge incoming tubes. The game features 30,000+ customization options, virtual currency (with the option of paying real money for them), leaderboard systems, difficulty systems, and even more features. 

## How do I play it?
Simple. Just go on the Google Play Store, search Cube Tube, and it should be the first option that comes up. Otherwise, you can go to the link here (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cube.tube&hl=en_US&gl=US)

## Why is Cube Tube in internal testing?
When I made the game, I had no intention of actually making users spend money to get certain features. I included the payment features to learn more about Google Pay API services. So as an internal tester, everyone gets a free test card meaning you can "buy" unlimited coins and have fun.

## What are the controls?
You can either use normal controls or tilt controls to move your character left or right by holding down the left and right arrows keys or holding down the tilt. To jump, you simply click the jump button and your character will go up slightly. There is a tutorial in the game, so you can check it out if you want a more interactive experience.

## Are you going to update the game?
Most likely, no. The game was a project meant for me to learn, and I want to move on to bigger and better projects. I think the game is enjoyable as it is, and I made the game after watching Brackey's tutorial series on Unity games. 

## Should I download it?
Of course! Many people who have downloaded it have loved it and love some of the "quirks" the game offers!
